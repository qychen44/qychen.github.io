<h2> Bio </h2>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student (Aug 2021 -- now)  in the <a href="https://eecs.ucmerced.edu/"> Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science </a> at <a href="https://www.ucmerced.edu/"> UC Merced </a>. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/sim3/"> Sungjin Im </a>.


<h2> Research Interests </h2>

I am broadly interested in Theoretical Computer Science, in particular approximation algorithms and online algorithms. Recently, I am also interested in the applications of metric embedding and continuous optimization in algorithm design.
